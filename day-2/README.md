# E-Commerce Website: Technical Foundation (Day 2)

## Project Overview
This repository documents the technical foundation planned on Day 2 of the hackathon for creating a robust e-commerce platform. The goal is to align technical solutions with business objectives and ensure seamless implementation.

## Key Highlights
- **Frontend**: Responsive and user-friendly design with essential pages.
- **Backend**: Managed by Sanity CMS for dynamic data handling.
- **API Integrations**: Support for local and global payment systems, user authentication, and shipment tracking.

## Features and Requirements

### Frontend Features:
- Dynamic, responsive pages: Home, Categories, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, and Order Confirmation.
- Real-time order tracking and location updates.
- Enhanced UX/UI for seamless navigation and user experience.

### Backend Features:
- **Sanity CMS**: Centralized data management for products, customers, and orders.
- Real-time inventory updates and order status tracking.

### API Integrations:
- **Clerk**: User authentication and profile management.
- **Stripe**: Secure payment processing.
- **Shipo**: Real-time shipment tracking.
- **Local Payment Solutions**: JazzCash, EasyPaisa, and bank transfers.

## System Architecture

### Overview:
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Handles user interactions and dynamic content rendering.
- **Backend (Sanity CMS)**: Manages and stores product, customer, and order data.
- **APIs**: Bridges the frontend and backend, enabling authentication, payments, and shipment tracking.

### Workflow:
1. User browses products.
2. Frontend fetches data from Sanity CMS.
3. Order placement updates Sanity and fetches shipment details via Shipo.
4. Payments processed through Stripe or local options.

## API Specifications

### Endpoints:
- **/products (GET)**: Fetch product details.
  - Response: `{ "id": 1, "name": "Product A", "price": 100, "stock": 20 }`
  
- **/orders (POST)**: Create a new order.
  - Payload: `{ "customerId": 123, "productDetails": [ { "id": 1, "quantity": 2 } ], "paymentStatus": "Paid" }`

- **/shipment (GET)**: Get shipment status.
  - Response: `{ "shipmentId": 456, "status": "In Transit", "ETA": "2 days" }`

- **/user (POST)**: User registration/login.
  - Payload: `{ "email": "example@example.com", "password": "password123" }`

- **/payment (POST)**: Process payments.
  - Payload: `{ "orderId": 789, "amount": 200, "status": "Paid" }`

## Roadmap
1. **Build the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**:
   - Focus on core features and workflows.
2. **Test APIs and system architecture with sample data**.
3. **Refine based on feedback for improved scalability and usability**.
